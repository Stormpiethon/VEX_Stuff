# VEX_Stuff
Code from the production studio team who competed in the "High-Stakes" robotics competition.

All of it was written using Python and added to the robot brain with the Visual Studio Code extension for VEX Robotics.

Programs include controller programming for driver control for both the small and large robot. As well as some miscellaneous
code snippets that could be useful.

Autonomous functions work on the larger robot, the sequences of movement just have to be added or modified to suit the objective.
